# WhatData-Shiny
Shiny App to find datasets available in R

This is the R Shiny version of [WhatData](https://github.com/saghirb/WhatData)

### Motivation & Objective

I often myself looking for R datasets of a particular class (e.g. `tbl_df`, `data.frame`, `ts`) for: 

* teaching
* presentations 
* preparing reproducible example code (see [`reprex`](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) package)
